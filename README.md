# BrGDGT-BinomialSourceModel
Binomial logistic regression model to estimate the probability that brGDGTs from samples of the Funza-II core are lake- or soil-derived. We used brGDGT abundances from both tropical soils and lakes deeper than 8 m as representative brGDGT end-members and selected the best parsimonious model.
