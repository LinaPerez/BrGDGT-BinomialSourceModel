# BrGDGT-BinomialSourceModel
Binomial logistic regression model to estimate the probability that brGDGTs from samples of the Funza-II core (or any core) are lake- or soil-derived. We used brGDGT abundances from both tropical soils (from Pérez-Angel et al., 2020) and lakes deeper than 8 meters (from Zhao et al., 2023) as representative brGDGT end-members and selected the best parsimonious model.
## Data files
'soil_lake_brGDGTs.txt' file contains the Fractional abundances (FA) of the modern soils and lakes selected for the model. In the 'Origin' column lake = 1 and soil = 0.
'FunzaII_Fa.txt' file contains the FA of the Funza-II core by Pérez-Angel et al. (2025 under review in PNAS)
